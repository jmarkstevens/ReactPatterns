# ReactPatterns

A collection of simple react projects providing reusable components, startup and test examples. Its my react playground.
I am now using webpack and babel for the build tool chain. Previous to the React.15 projects, I had used gulp, browserify and babelify.
Since React.14 I am using babel stage 0 with arrow functions and let instead of var. With React.15 the build is now all webpack.

# The basics

Open two terminals at the desired project root. I use iTerm on Mac, ConEmu on Windows 10.
First time do "npm install". On the React.15 projects in one terminal "npm run ww".
On the older projects in one terminal "gulp". In the other terminal "npm start" or for Electron "npm run".
In your browser localhost:3500. All projects use the same port.
If you want to do it with one terminal session you can run "npm run nw" for no watch.
