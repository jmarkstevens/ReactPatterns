# ReactPatterns ReduxFetch

A basic demonstration of Redux with fetch polyfill. This would be the starting point for a simple data handling app.
The 15 version uses more es6 and refines the reflux usage a bit.

# Getting started

cd into the root directory of the project. If the first time "npm install". "npm run ww" for webpack with watch.
"npm run nw" for webpack no watch. "npm start" to start the node server. "localhost:3500" in the browser.
